Droid48sx is a modified version of droid48 but for HP48 SX, credit goes to Arnaud Brochard (author of droid48 for Android)
and of course Eddie C. Dost (author of x48 for UNIX). If you came from Windows, and like Emu48 (written by Sebastien Carlier
and Christoph Gie√üelink), you can also get Emu48 for Android (written by Regis Cosnier)
