48sx : The HP48 sx emulator !

HP48sx is a vintage RPN calculator. I used this calc 25 years ago ;-) I love this calc....and now I can have it in my pocket every day !

No nag, no Ad, completely FREE!

48sx is a modified version of droid48 but for the HP48 SX, the credit goes to Arnaud Brochard (author of droid48 for Android), 
and of course Eddie C. Dost (author of x48 for UNIX) who created an emulator of the Saturn processor in 1990.
