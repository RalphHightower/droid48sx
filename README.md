## 48sx: The HP48 SX Emulator!

The HP48 SX is a vintage RPN calculator that many of us remember with fondness.
I used this calculator 30 years ago and fell in love with it. Now, I can carry
it in my pocket every day!

(author of x48 for UNIX), who created an emulator of the Saturn processor in 1990.
